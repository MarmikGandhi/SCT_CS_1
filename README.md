# 🔐 Caesar Cipher – Encryption & Decryption Tool

This is **Task 01** for the **Cyber Security Internship** at **SkillCraft Technology**.  
The task involves building a simple Caesar Cipher program to **encrypt** and **decrypt** messages using a shift value.

---

## 📌 Project Details

- **Internship Track**: Cyber Security
- **Task Code**: `SCT_CS_1`
- **Topic**: Caesar Cipher Algorithm
- **Language Used**: Python

---

## 🚀 Features

- Encrypts any alphabetic message using a user-defined shift.
- Decrypts the encrypted message using the same shift.
- Works with both uppercase and lowercase letters.
- Ignores and preserves non-alphabet characters like spaces, numbers, and punctuation.

```plaintext
=== Caesar Cipher Encryption / Decryption ===
Enter your message: Hello World
Enter shift value (number): 5

🔒 Encrypted: Mjqqt Btwqi
🔓 Decrypted: Hello World
```

## 📚 How It Works

The **Caesar Cipher** is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the text is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the alphabet.  
Example:  
- Message: `HELLO`, Shift: `3`  
- Encrypted: `KHOOR`
